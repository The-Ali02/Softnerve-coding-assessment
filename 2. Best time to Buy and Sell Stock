Question 2 :Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. 
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. 
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Test case Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] 
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. 
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

#Code :

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		int prices [] = {7,1,5,3,6,4};
		System.out.println(maxProfitFromStock(prices));
	}
	static int maxProfitFromStock(int prices[]){
	    int maxProfit = 0, minSoFar = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
	    for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
	       if(minSoFar>prices[i]){
	           minSoFar = prices[i];
	       }
	       maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit,prices[i]-minSoFar);
	    }
	    return maxProfit;
	}
}
